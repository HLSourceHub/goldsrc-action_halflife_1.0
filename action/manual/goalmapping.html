				<td class="blocksatz"><span class="subheadline">Introduction</span><br>
				Half-life : Directors Cut allows map entities to control a game. If a server is running in teamplay with 
				rounds mode and has goal modes enabled (mp_goalsoff 0) ,it will check to see if any game_score 
				entities exist in the map upon loading. If any do exist in the map, the server will 
				use the entities in the map to run the game.
				This effectively allows mappers to create their own game modes 
				using existing half-life entities and AHL specific entities. 
				Specific AHL entities are described in the Map entities section. 
				Here we will describe how some of those entities are used. For the purposes of this tutorial
				we will use examples from two maps in RC2. Urban Riot and Action Railroad. Entities described
				in this tutorial have been extracted from the maps with the 'ripent' tool. This tool allows you
				to import and export entities to and from a BSP map file. This allows mappers to edit entities
				without recompiling the map.
				<br>
				<br>	
				<span class="subheadline">Noreset Flag</span><br>
				The noreset flag is used to stop entities being used in normal DM play. The noreset flag should be set to '2'  to do this.
				<br>
				<br>	
				<span class="subheadline">Game Team Masters</span><br>
				Urban Riot is setup with two teams. Each team has game_team_master entity. Here I have kept things very simple. Each master is assigned a teamname. This teamname is used to reference the info_team entity that will be described a little later on. 

				<br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-3131 3347 -1962"<br>
				"targetname" "t1master"<br>
				"teamname" "The Cops"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "game_team_master"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-3128 3236 -1962"<br>
				"targetname" "t2master"<br>
				"teamname" "The Mob"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "game_team_master"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				In some maps you may find that a game_team_master has a field called 'teamindex' followed 
				by a number. This is an older way of indexing teams in AHL. People would either 
				specify the team order with '1','2','3' and so forth, or use '-1' to let the engine 
				create the order. Some entities would then later reference the teamindex number, 
				rather than use the teamname field. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<span class="subheadline">Info Teams</span><br>
				Each team also has an info_team entity. This entity defines the team's name, 
				model, lives and respawn times. Each info_team entity MUST have a master that 
				is a game_team_master. A -1 in the lives field simply means 'infinite'. Respawn 
				times are in seconds. In Urban riot there are no subteams. We will discuss 
				subteams later on. When you have set an info_team entity master's field to a 
				targetname of a master, you need to set it's 'name' field to match the 
				game_team_master's teamname field. 
				<br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-3128 3314 -1938"<br>
				"master" "t1master"<br>
				"name" "The Cops" <br>
				"angle" "360"<br>
				"model" "nsi_swat"<br>
				"lives" "-1"<br>
				"respawn" "5"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "info_team"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-3128 3268 -1938"<br>
				"master" "t2master"<br>
				"name" "The Mob"<br>
				"angle" "360"<br>
				"model" "jawb"<br>
				"lives" "3"<br>
				"respawn" "0.5"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "info_team"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>

				NOTE: The order of the info_team entities is very important. The order in which they 
				appear in the entity list of a map, is the order they will appear in the game. 
				For teams without subteams this is simple. info_team order for subteams will be discussed later.
				 <br>
				<br>
				<span class="subheadline">Monster Victims</span><br>
				The NPC victim for Urban Riot is a monster_victim entity. monster_victim entities are like their name, victims. They stay in one spot and can be killed. 
				Urban Riot's looks like the following :<br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-1969 1587 -1810"<br>
				"model" "models/player/alan/alan.mdl"<br>    
				"rendercolor" "0 0 0"<br>  
				"angle" "180" <br> 	
				"vic_init_health" "500" <br>       
				"master" "t1master" <br>
				"deadtarget" "t1_deadwit" <br>  
				"noreset" "2"<br>			
				"classname" "monster_victim"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				The monster_victim entity defines the model, angle, health of the NPC. If the NPC has a master, that team is effectively allied with the NPC and they cannot harm the NPC at all.Having the NPC share the same master of 'The Cops' means that no one from that team could spoil the game by killing the person they are supposed to be protecting.  deadtarget describes the entity that should be triggered upon the demise of the NPC. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<span class="subheadline">When a NPC Dies</span><br>
				The entity that deadtarget triggers to is t1_deadwit. This is a multi_manager entity. 
				This particular multi-manager triggers two further entities. 
				roundend and t2_score which are both multi-managers. roundend has a delay of 2 seconds here. 
				<br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-2033 1570 -1792"<br>
				"targetname" "t1_deadwit"<br>
				"roundend" "2"<br>
				"t2_score" "0"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "multi_manager"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
			
				<span class="subheadline">When a NPC Dies</span><br>
				There is only one roundend entity in urban riot. Only one is really need as it 
				simply just ends the current round. There is a pause of 3.5 seconds before it fires.
				<br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-2475 3272 -1960"<br>
				"wait" "3.5"<br>
				"targetname" "roundend"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "game_roundend"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				<span class="subheadline">Events for NPC Death</span><br>
				The t2_score entity is another multi-manager that kicks off entities to give a victory 
				to 'The Mob'. The endroundcam camera entity is called to give a view of the NPC.
				 Next the t2_scorecounter, t2_scoretext and t2_gamescore entities are called 
				with a 1 second delay. <br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-2060 1567 -1832"<br>
				"endroundcam" "0"<br>
				"t2_scorecounter" "1"<br>
				"t2_scoretext" "1"<br>
				"t2_gamescore" "1"<br>
				"targetname" "t2_score"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "multi_manager"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				<span class="subheadline">Camera Entity</span><br>
				The standard halflife camera entities consist of two parts. 
				The camera itself (trigger_camera) and a target (info_target).
				 Basically a camera will be set up to aim at the target and will show that view 
				when triggered. The 'wait' field for the camera defines how long (in seconds) 
				the view should be held. The target field is set to an info_target entity 
				(camtarg). The spanwflags is set to 12. This equates to the following bit flags being set.
				<br> 
				"Freeze Player" = 4 <br>
				"Force ALL Players To Camera = 8 <br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-2236 1516 -1743"<br>
				"deceleration" "500"<br>
				"acceleration" "500"<br>
				"wait" "5"<br>
				"target" "camtarg"<br>
				"targetname" "endroundcam"<br>
				"spawnflags" "12"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "trigger_camera"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				The camera targets simply have a name that the camera references for it view angle. 
				<br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-2010 1566 -1775"<br>
				"targetname" "camtarg"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "info_target"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				<span class="subheadline">Game Counter</span><br>
				There are two game_counter entities in Urban Riot, one for each team.
				 The t2_scorecounter keeps tracks of how many rounds 'The Mob' have one. 
				The health field is the threshold at which this entity will trigger the 'gameover' entity. 
				Each time the t2_scorecounter is called it increments it count by one. 
				Therefore if 'The Mob' kill the NPC 5 times, the game will end. 
				<br>
				<br>  
				{<br>
				"origin" "-1945 1520 -1836"<br>
				"targetname" "t2_scorecounter"<br>
				"health" "5"<br>
				"target" "gameover"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "game_counter"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				<span class="subheadline">Game End</span><br>
				The game_end entity simply ends the current game. 
				Can be used to end a game when a certain score is reached for example.
				<br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-3200 -71 -579"<br>
				"targetname" "gameover"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "game_end"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				<span class="subheadline">Game Text</span><br>
				There are two game_text entities in Urban riot. 
				They notify the two teams on who has won the round. The t2_scoretext 
				entity below notifies everyone that the NPC has died. Currently game_text entities 
				are not team specific yet. <br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-1946 1547 -1840"<br>
				"targetname" "t2_scoretext"<br>
				"message" "The Mob have silenced the rat!"<br>
				"channel" "4"<br>
				"fxtime" "0.25"<br>
				"holdtime" "5"<br>
				"fadeout" "0.1"<br>
				"fadein" "0.1"<br>
				"color2" "240 110 0"<br>
				"color" "255 255 255"<br>
				"y" "0.4"<br>
				"x" "-1"<br>
				"spawnflags" "1"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "game_text"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				<span class="subheadline">Game Score</span><br>
				The game_score entity is extremely important. 
				The detection of one of these entities make AHL recognise that there is a goal.
				 This entity can be used to add or subract points from a team. To subtract points simply use 
				a negative value. The points are added to whatever teamname is specified. 
				Game_score will add points to the team specified by the teamname attribute. <br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-1968 1543 -1840"<br>
				"points" "1"<br>
				"teamname" "The Mob"<br>
				"targetname" "t2_gamescore"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "game_score"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				<span class="subheadline">Game Player Die</span><br>
				The game_player_die entity is used to fire an event either when a whole team 
				is killed, or a person on a team has been killed. 
				The targetname field for this entity MUST be game_playerdie, otherwise this 
				entity will not function. Here the entity will fire 't2_alldeadmm' 
				(which is a multimanager to scoring a notification entities) 
				when all of 'The Mob' team is dead. The presence of spawnflags=1 makes the 
				game_player_die entity fire its target only when a whole team is dead 
				(when no body has any lives left). If the spanwflag=1 is not present or some 
				other value, the entity will fire upon every death of a member of that team.
				 The most important attribute for the game_player_die entity is the master.
				 This must be set to be the same as the team's game_team_master if you wish to act
				 on the death of all members of that team. Dependent on the type of team it is, 
				you will need to set the spawnflags to either :<br>
				<br>
				1 = Whole Team <br>
				2 = Sub Team (See Terrorist Leader in actionrail).<br>
				<br>  
				{<br>
				"origin" "-2573 3225 -1968"<br>
				"target" "t2_alldeadmm"<br>
				"master" "t2master"<br>
				"targetname" "game_playerdie"<br>
				"spawnflags" "1"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "game_player_die"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				<span class="subheadline">Spawn Points</span><br>
				Spawn points for Goals are handled differently than say Teamplay. For a team
				to spawn, you must have a number of spawn points (one per expected member of the
				team). This is slightly different from Teamplay spawn points whereby one spawn
				is chosen and the whole team is spawned around it. There are adavantages to this
				approach however. You can now spawn a team over a number of different spawn points
				(like the bodyguards in Wikkecity), or you could just put all their spawn points 
				near each other (as in urban riot). <br>
				Spawn points are tied to specific teams by tieing them to a specific master. This 
				also has the upshot of effectively disabling them during Teamplay and DM modes.<br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-2944 2421 -1943"<br>
				"master" "t1master"<br>
				"classname" "info_player_deathmatch"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>

				<span class="subheadline">Maximum and Minimum Team Sizes</span><br>
				You may wish to produce a map where you have a team of which you want only 1
				 player to be a part of, or for some other reason you want to limit the maximum number
				 of players for. This is achieved through the max_members field in the info_team entity.
				 Below is an example of the terrorist in actionrail.
				 Here no more than 1 person may join the team.<br>
				You may also wish to make sure that a team has a certain number of
				 players before starting a game. The actionrail Terrorist Leader is a good 
				example for this also. The Terrorist Leader is an integral part of the game mode,
				 therefore it would be stupid to allow players to start a game without one. 
				This is solved by the min_members attribute. 
				The min_members attribute will stop a game starting if the minimum numbers of 
				players is not reached. If during a game the number of players falls below the 
				min_members value, the game will halt and restart upon satisfying 
				the min_numbers attribute.<br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-3248 -736 -256"<br>
				"max_members" "1"<br>
				"min_members" "1"<br>
				"sub_team" "Terrorists"<br>
				"model" "trinRAGE"<br>
				"name" "Terrorist Leader"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "info_team"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>


				<span class="subheadline">Subteams</span><br>
				You may wish to have subteams on a goal map such as a VIP/Bodyguards or split one 
				team into two for guarding two tactical locations. The order in which you have to 
				create these is important. The example we are going to use here is actionrail. 
				Actionrail has two main teams. <br>
				<br>
				Counter Terrorists <br>
				Terrorists <br>
				<br>
				The Counter Terrorist team is made up of two teams :<br>
				<br>
				Tactical Ops<br>
				SWAT<br>
				<br>
				The Terrorists team is made up of two teams :<br>
				<br>
				Terrorist Leader<br>
				Thugs<br>
				<br>
				How do these link? Its relatively simple. Declare the first two main teams 
				like the example below : <br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-3248 -864 -256"<br>
				"name" "Counter Terrorists"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "info_team"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-3248 -704 -256"<br>
				"name" "Terrorists"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "info_team"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				Now you have to declare the other 4 teams in a specific order dependant 
				on how you delcared the first two. In this example we declared the Counter 
				Terrorists first, so now we have to declare BOTH Counter Terrorist subteams.  
				<br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-3248 -896 -256"<br>
				"sub_team" "Counter Terrorists"<br>
				"lives" "4"<br>
				"respawn" "1"<br>
				"model" "tacteq"<br>
				"name" "Tactical Ops"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "info_team"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-3248 -928 -256"<br>
				"sub_team" "Counter Terrorists"<br>
				"respawn" "1"<br>
				"lives" "4"<br>
				"model" "nsi_swat"<br>
				"name" "SWAT"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "info_team"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				And now we declare the two Terrorist Subteams.<br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-3248 -736 -256"<br>
				"max_members" "1"<br>
				"sub_team" "Terrorists"<br>
				"model" "trinRAGE"<br>
				"name" "Terrorist Leader"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "info_team"<br>
				}<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-3248 -768 -256"<br>
				"lives" "4"<br>
				"respawn" "1"<br>
				"sub_team" "Terrorists"<br>
				"model" "the_one"<br>
				"name" "Thugs"<br>
				"noreset" "2"<br>
				"classname" "info_team"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>
				BUT HANG ON! Havent you made a mistake, it says here in the entity above 
				that the sub_team is Terrorists? Yes it does, in actual fact you have 4 teams,
				 2 of which are actually linked by that sub_team. The team structure 
				internally in the game is thus :<br>
				<br>
				<img src="images/subteams.jpg" width="376" height="159" border="2"><br><br><br>

				
				<span class="subheadline">Game Player Die for Subteams</span><br>
				
				Game_player_die with a spawnflag of 1 will fire when a whole team id dead. 
				If a team consists of two or more subteams, then it will only fire when there are 
				no members left alive in any of the subteams. Obviously this would be bad on a map
				 like actionrail. For if the Leader died, no trigger would activate as the rest
				 of her team would still be alive in the other subteam. Therefore you have to 
				use a spawnflags '2' setting if you wish to activate game_playerdie for 1 
				individual subteam like below. <br>
				<br>
				{<br>
				"origin" "-3168 -704 -256"<br>
				"master" "wiliger_master"<br>
				"target" "wiliger_dead"<br>
				"targetname" "game_playerdie"<br>
				"spawnflags" "2"<br>
				"classname" "game_player_die"<br>
				}<br>
				<br>

				<span class="subheadline">Summary</span><br>
				Making a simple goal map for AHL is not too hard (I managed it didnt I?). 
				Plenty of the halflife entities should work in AHL, so go mad an experiment.
				 There is always help in the forums if your stuck. <br>
