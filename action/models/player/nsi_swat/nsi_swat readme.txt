This model is 100% made from scratch by me, so please if you're gonna hack it to death let me know.

The model is a SWAT assault unit, all equipment and garment is (loosely) based on real equipment, down to the boots.

** IMPORTANT **

This model should NOT be distributed in any kind of commercial compilation, product or package without my personal approval.
This model CAN otherwise be distributed freely as long as this text file is included, unmodified, with the package.
And PLEASE don't extract the skin and draw a mustache on it and release it to the world as yours, don't be lame.
