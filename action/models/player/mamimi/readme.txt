[ credits: 
decimal - for the original model 
digital_nomad - mega thanks for the laborious task of attaching
		the skeleton and fixing clipping problems
sonique128 - i skinned the damn thing, added the skirt and reshaped her head
		but without the help of digital_nomad and decimal, this model
		would've never came out. give them many kudos :D ]
