Description : A replacement player model for AHL based upon "Tok" the character played by Andy Lau in the Hong Kong action film "Fulltime Killer" directed by Johnnie To and Wai Ka Fai.

Background : Tok is a Cantonese killer for hire in the murky criminal underworld. His ambition is to become the number one hitman in Asia, a position currently occupied by the Japanese professional known only as "O". In his attempt to climb to the top, Tok is prepared to take any job no matter what the risk or how impossible it seems, in order to get his name known in the criminal circuit. Mentally unstable and obsessed with action cinema, Tok takes inspiration from his favourite films in the planning and execution of his hits. Brash, showy, outlandish and flashy, Tok is a dangerous and unpredictable opponent for anyone.

Thanks to: Borg, Mel, Skammy and the rest of the HOF crew, MP Len, Sonic128 and Digiboy for years of patience with my consistantly cack-handed skinning efforts, Kameh BoB and the rest of the HOF community, and last but not least Johnnie To + Wai Ka Fai + Andy Lau + Takeshi Sorimachi for reviving the blood opera. 

Oh and thanks for downloading this ^_^!
