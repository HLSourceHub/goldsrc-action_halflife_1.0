Description : A replacement player model for AHL based upon "O" the character played by Takeshi Sorimachi in the Hong Kong action film "Fulltime Killer" directed by Johnnie To and Wai Ka Fai.

Background : The number one hitman in Asia is known only by his alias "O". Top of Interpol's most wanted list and under constant attack from rivals, O lives in a fortified concrete safehouse across the street from his apartment for safety. After the murder of his housekeeper, O tries to keep a low profile. However, when newcomer Tok starts blazing a path through the hitman scene with O's name on his bullets, the Japanese assassin is forced to fight him or be wiped off the map.

Thanks to: Borg, Mel, Skammy and the rest of the HOF crew, MP Len, Sonic128 and Digiboy for years of patience with my consistantly cack-handed skinning efforts, Kameh BoB and the rest of the HOF community, and last but not least Johnnie To + Wai Ka Fai + Andy Lau + Takeshi Sorimachi for reviving the blood opera. 

Oh and thanks for downloading this ^_^!
