BASICS:
Type        : Quick-draw holster
Usage       : Fast switching between guns

TACTICAL/COMMENTS: 
The quick-draw holster is a very useful item when you are out of ammo and need your secondary weapon as soon as possible. Many snipers choose a quick holster because once the enemy is near every second counts. Some players feel somehow safer when they are able to switch their weapons faster than their enemies can.  

AS SEEN IN:
Holstered pistols are often carried below the shoulder by cops to easily draw them. Therefore they are starring in lots of action movies like Lethal Weapon.
