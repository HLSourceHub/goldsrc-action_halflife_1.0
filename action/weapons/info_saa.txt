TACTICAL/COMMENTS:
The Single Action Army is a difficult to maintain handgun. Both its good accuracy and penetration have a price: reloading is very complicated therefore find a safe place when attempting to reload. One of the pros of the SAA is the ability of "fanning" when used single-handed. Releasing the hammer in quick succession can result in an excellent rate of fire.

AS SEEN IN:
Starring mostly in westerns, the SAA is not a very common sight in action movies but shows up from time to time.
