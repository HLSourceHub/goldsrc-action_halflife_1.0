TACTICAL/COMMENTS:
The 1911s are a pair of strong and accurate handguns, which can take down most enemies with a few shots. However the guns don't have large clips, so you have to carefully pick your targets. A bandolier is very useful here to get more ammo, but kevlar vests and even stealth slippers are common selections too.

AS SEEN IN:
