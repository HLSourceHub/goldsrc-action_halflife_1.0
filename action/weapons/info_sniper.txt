TACTICAL/COMMENTS:
The semi-auto sniper rifle offers both precision and a good firerate. From a secure position you can pin down an enemy team easily, giving your team a good chance to rush them. Unfortunately you can run out of ammo very quickly, and a kevlar vest significantly reduces the damage done. Shoot for the head and make your shots count.

AS SEEN IN:
Semi-auto sniper rifles like the MSG90 or the Barret M82A1 are a common sight in many action movies like The Killer, Lethal Weapon, The Replacement Killers and Face/Off.
