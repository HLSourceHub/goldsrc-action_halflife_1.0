BASICS:
Type        : Silencer
Usage       : Decreases firing noise

TACTICAL/COMMENTS: 
With a silencer you can surprise an enemy easily. The firing sound is greatly reduced when in use and your muzzle flash will also be hidden. You can usually get quite a few shots off without the target realising they are even being shot at, let alone where it's coming from.  Especially in a nice dark corner.

AS SEEN IN:
Silencers can be found in many action movies. Boondock Saints, Ghost Dog and most James Bond movies to name a few.
