TACTICAL/COMMENTS:
Grenades only have one purpose: mass destruction. They are very useful when the enemies are crowded or camping around a corner. But beware, once the pin has been pulled, detonation is inevitable. Diving out of the way can save your ass when you see a grenade land next to you more often than not, learn to dive when you hear that clank of the grenade landing nearby. Be wary when shooting somebody holding a live grenade, when they die it will fall to the floor and explode.
