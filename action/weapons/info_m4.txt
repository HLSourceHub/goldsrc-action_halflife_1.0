TACTICAL/COMMENTS:
The M4 is best used for medium to long ranged fire support. You only have 24 bullets per clip, so using single shot or 3 round burst is recommended. It's a bulky weapon that decreases the player's movement capabilities when fired, so it may be wise to use it with a kevlar vest to shrug off enemy fire. Once you open fire, it will tear through your opponents with its high damage and penetration.

AS SEEN IN:
Action movies with great assault rifle firefights are Heat and Bullet in the Head.
