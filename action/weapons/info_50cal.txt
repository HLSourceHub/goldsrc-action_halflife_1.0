TACTICAL/COMMENTS:
With most hits being fatal, the bolt-action sniper rifle is a very powerful weapon. But this power has its price, in most cases you have to take an enemy down with a single shot or you may be in big trouble. This makes the quick-holster and the kevlar vest the sniper's best friends.

AS SEEN IN:
In many an action movie or war movie you will find some sort of bolt-action sniper rifle like the McMillian Bros .50cal or the AWM. Films like Saving Private Ryan or Enemy at the Gates are great examples.
