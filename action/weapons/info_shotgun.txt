TACTICAL/COMMENTS:
The perfect close-assault weapon thanks to its good firerate, damage and ammo loadout. Victims won't stand a chance against its buckshot at close range, and it causes a fair amount of damage at medium range. Preferred usage is in combination with either a kevlar vest or stealth slippers.
