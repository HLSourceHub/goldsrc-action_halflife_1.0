TACTICAL/COMMENTS:
The Colt 1911 is a strong and accurate handgun, which can take down most enemies with a few shots. However it doesn't have a large clip, so you have to carefully pick your targets. A bandolier is very useful here to get more ammo, but kevlar vests and even stealth slippers are common selections too.

AS SEEN IN:
The Colt 1911 can be seen in large numbers in Last Man Standing and, the source of inspiration for gold 1911s, Face/Off.
