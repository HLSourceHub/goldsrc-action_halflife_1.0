BASICS:
Type        : Submachine gun

Damage      : Low

TACTICAL/COMMENTS:
The submachine gun is a very flexible weapon, useable for both close-combat and medium-ranged firefights. Even though it does relatively low damage, this can be a very effective all-round weapon if you use the different firemodes to your advantage. You will find that the submachine gun works well with all items.

AS SEEN IN:
Most HK Blood Operas and almost every Holywood Action Film. In fact, I would like to see an action movie with NO submachine guns... Die Hard 3 features loads of MP5K, The original Die Hard features the MP5 as well. Check out Hard Boiled and the Killer for some more submachine gun action.
