// Action Halflife mapcycle.txt
// Designates what maps are in the server rotation.
//
// You can also set parameters that designate whether a map
// will load or not based on the amount of players in the 
// game.
//
// To make a minimum number of players required for a map to 
// change, use "\minplayers\#" where # is a number.
// ex: ahl_map "\minplayers\4"
// This would make the map only load if there were at least 
// 4 players in the game at the time of map change.
//
// Similar to the minimum number of players, you can set a 
// maximum number of players. If there are more than the 
// specified number of players in the game at the time of 
// map change, then the map will not load and will skip to
// the next one. This is best for small maps that wouldn't
// have enough room for large games. 
// ex: ahl_map "\maxplayers\12"
// This would make AHL check to see if there were more than 
// 12 players in the game at the time of map change, and if
// there were, the map wouldn't load and the next map in the
// list would instead.
//
// You can also combine the min and max player fields.
// ex: ahl_map "\minplayers\2\maxplayers\12"
// This would only load the map if there were between 2 and
// 12 players in the game.
