                  DM CLINIC (Ver 1.6) 
                    (clinic16.bsp) 
        (info follows lower down in clinic16.txt)

Its after midnight in the eerie Kavorkian Medical Center
time to keep up the fine tradition of this place by 
blasting each other to bits!

This map is meant for Beta3 or better of Action-HalfLife
and was designed with both deathmatch AND teamplay in mind.

Title			:The Evil Hell Clinic DEATHMATCH REMIX v1.6
Author			:Nicholas 'ProMagnoN' Lawson
Date Released           :May 22, 2000
Filename		:clinic16.bsp
Email Address		:promagnon@home.com
Quick Description       :The kavorkian medical center - Smaller version, rerelease 1.2
Other                   :This map is meant for ACTION HALF-LIFE, but will probably work ok
                         elsewhere.  I think.  Just not very well.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Single Player		:No.
Deathmatch		:Yes.
Teamply 		:Yes.
Difficulty Settings	:No.
New textures		:Yes.
New sounds		:No.
Running the level	:Just unzip the ZIP file, pointing to your half life directory.
                         Remember to unzip retaining folder names, and the appropriate
                         files should be put into the appropriate directories.  Otherwise
                         just copy the bsp file into your 
                         Half-Life\action\maps directory.  Start the game normally and the map
                         should appear in the multiplayer game start setup... or join a server
                         already running it.
			 Its 2.5 megs, but will autodownload correctly.  The new textures
                         Are inside the BSP file, so there's no need to download WAD files
                         also.
*Construction*

Base			:My own DMCLINIC.bsp, modified according to specs by HolyGoat.
Editor used		:Worldcraft 2.1
Build time		:Couple hours to compile, months 
                         and months to create.
Known bugs		:None. But yell if you find some!
Textures		:Done by Rat-X (ratx@home.com) and myself!
Compile machine		:P2 300 w/64mb RAM,  32mb TNT2!  I love my TNT2.  If youre
                         serious about mapping get an NVIDIA card, screw 3dfx.  It can 
                         hardware accelerated render in worldcraft :)
			 Thank goodness I kept the R_Speeds reasonable.  (Check em out!)
                         Despite its size it runs quite smoothly on this lowly machine,
                         due to a lot of careful func_wall-ing and vis blocking.

I think I may have repeatedly misspelled kavorkian.  It has nothing to do with clans of similar
names.  Heh.  Any resemblance to people or places living or dead is purely a figment of your
imagination. (lol)

*credits*
Credits go  to Valve, for the good engine, Axel and HolyGoat (from the action half-life 
development team) for the toilet flushing sounds, and Lord Dakushna (Dakushna@aol.com) 
for the toilet models!  Some of Valve's prefabs are used, but the unrecognisable 
furniture and beds and chairs and cash registers, etc are mine, except for the monitors.  
Those were done by Revolver (Revolver@gpm98.freeserve.co.uk).  Thanks!
