The Crooked City

This map is the 3rd and final innercity map, the culmination of everything I've tried to achieve in the previous maps, it's about as close as I can get in the HL engine. There's lots of influences to this map, apart from my time spent in Newport,South Wales, games such as the silent hill series and the underated Project Eden.
