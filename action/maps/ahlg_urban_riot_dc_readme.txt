AHL Goal Map Urban Riot  - Assasination
=======================================

Goal mode version of this map. The cops have to protect the witness from the mob. 
The witness is hiding in his flat above the circle-H shop. 
The Cops get infinite lives but have a delay in re-spawning. The Mob get 3 lives each.
The mob must kill the witness to win. The Cops must eliminate the entire Mob hit team
to win. 



AHL Urban Riot v4
====================

Changes in 4

The saftey cage on the ladder at the side of the Circle-H store was too far from
the ladder and caused players to fall down injuring themselves rather than safely
placing them on the ladder. This has been corrected. 



Changes in 3.9

Due to lag over network play, 2.1 was far too complex to be played over the network, 
though performed ok on a LAN. 3.9 was made larger but less complex. 


Changes in v2.1
---------------

Mat file errors corrected, thanks to Kissamies. 
Zip file for all installaphobes. 
Rain removed to increase FPS.
Windows widened in flat to aid stunting  and
coach roof accessible from road. Suggested by [A$Z]Borg
Billboard lights made uncampable on suggestion from [A$Z]Larusso



Changes in v2
--------------

Players radio binds are now audible.

Map was reskinned a bit.

Extra vehicles added.

Waypoint file added.

Thanks to Action Stylez [A$Z] and the Mellow Out Massive [MOM] crews for allowing tests
