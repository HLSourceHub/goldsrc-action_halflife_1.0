Some old beta history:


3/4/02:

Ok RL is still hectic but I wanna get this map out there. I've retextured places and replaced the A-team van with somthing else. (coz I didn't like the model)  anyway check it out.  Feedback to the usual address:   octavedoctor@telefragged.com   
This is the final layout 


New:
17/10/01

LOC file!!! :D :D :D

16/10/01

Major overhauls of certain areas- mostly tidying up ropey brush work, added more realistic textures. Added two extra security cameras that both look inside the dam. Added a 'booth' around cam controls.  Sparky bits added.  map.ini file added.

12/10/01

Nothing new

11/10/01
The A-team Van, start that baby up! sounds sweet.
More ammo, and knives in the water.
Moved handcannon down to deep pool over cracks where bubbles come out. Moved colt 1911 that was there up to the top of the round turbine booth.
Added lights to the shallow water- looks much better and you can see what's going on now.

8/10/01
Whole new area: Turbine room in centre of dam, turbines activate when the master switch is thrown up in the round control booth outside, turbines hot (20 damage) when active. 
New sounds: various industrial sounds raided from valve's pak. Not too black mesa-ry
9/10/01
Added another 'creaky bit' by the ladder and broken planks.

Fixes:
17/10/01

Fixed CSG error on A-team van. Fixed lift entrance, tweaked some other stuff.

16/10/01

Now impossible to break turbines! Huzzah!  Adjusted hieght of light polls on top dam u can now dive freely off the dam!  Fixed lift area completely- no more dying at top or bottom- no lights clip the lift either. Fixed the sky 'spike' that Luebbi and Pokey both pointed out. Some other stuff but I can't remember

12/10/01

Fixed the trigger_pushes in the water you should no longer get stuck
Added a delay to the turbine switches- it should now be impossible to break them.

11/10/01

Fixed the lift because a few people will still sticking their heads out this now means light fixtures can be seen passing through the lift itself so I dunno what to do- cry mebe?
Added clip brushes around suspended ceiling pipes -should stop people from getting stuck now.
Made the vertical turbine suck even stronger- this now means you can do marvelous stingray dives out of the water when the turbines are on- oh and if you don't swim you get sucked down very quickly.

8/10/01

You have the proper sky!!! I never put it in the zip (doh)  nice sunrise now. 
More ammo (but not much)
various stuff that broke whilst adding the new room (hence the jump from b3 to b5)

9/10/01
Fixed Turbine suck in water- now the right  way round!
Fixed the staircase leading to the main turbine room- you don't get stuck any more
