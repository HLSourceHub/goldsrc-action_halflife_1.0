Info
----
A small-ish map based on a city street theme, there's a mix of external and
internal areas to suit different weapon types.

R_speeds average about 400-700 for outdoor areas, much lower for internal stuff.
The silver roofed H building has prolly got the highest r's, avoid this bit if
you've got a low spec system.

Installing
----------
Unzip into the \action folder with Create Folders on.
  .BSP files go into \maps
  .TGA's go in \gfx\env
  .MDL's go in \models\beemer
  .WAV's go in \sound\beemer


History
-------
Map originally started out as a HLDM/The Specialists level and was inspired
by some .RMF map files that i saw in a mapping competition in the TS forums. 
Two map sections are loosely based on .RMF's by Schmung and Insulaner, had
to completely rework them so there's prolly little left of the originals.


Trouble Shooting
----------------
Trees have blue "leaves" - the trees use new rendering technology used in DOD
v1 and CS 1.6, installing either of these mods will update HalfLife with the
code needed to render the trees correctly. As of writing its not enough to
patch HalfLife (non Steam) as AFAIK Valve haven't included this technology
in the latest patch.
