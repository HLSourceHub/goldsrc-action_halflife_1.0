------About This Map-------------------------------------------------

This map started as a quick conversion of the Goldeneye map Temple, from the N64 game by Rare. However, it quickly became its own map and only some minor similarities remain, mostly in parts of the layout.


------Credits and Thanks---------------------------------------------

BORG for taking interest in this map and for his suggestions. Also for the beautiful music track you heard in the lower room with the large tree. And the lava glubbing sound.

Octave Doctor for the wind sound on the balcony.

Phostoxin (Jako Malan) (dfm@msi.imt.za) - for the new sky used in this map. I got the sky on Wadfather (http://www.planethalflife.com/wadfather).

TheDoenerKing - for the nice tree model you see in the lower room (http://www.thedoenerking.de).

Crinity - I the flaming pots you see around the map are heavily modified from the prefabs on his site. (http://www.planethalflife.com/crinity)

Half-Life Exodus Open-Source - a couple sounds from this cancelled mod. (http://www.code4me.de/exodus/)

MeanRabbit.com - (http://www.meanrabbit.com) for some of the nice ambient sounds you hear in this map (mr_ prefix). I emailed them about using their sounds in my maps, and they were very cool about it. 

The Snarkpit crew, whose feedback was very beneficial.

Playtesters, and everyone else who gave feedback.

My fellow mappers, and the rest of the AHL community for being great people to work with and game with. (Except for Jinky and Crimson_Fox. Go to hell you two!)

The A-Team for this great mod.


------Texture Credits------------------------------------------------

Blazeeer: This guy has a ton of great original textures available, and they are the primary textures I used when I went back to revamp this map. They are mostly from blaz_sandwad. Thank you SO MUCH for making and sharing these textures!!! (http://www.blaz.cscentral.com/textures.htm)

Deathmatch Classic: some textures are from this mod's wad. (it's valve, so I think it's free to use)

------Additional Info, Tips, and Notes-------------------------------

In Rounded modes, doors will begin closing after 80 seconds to seal off the main room (the big one with two levels and the pool to dive into below). Anyone left outside after they close will be killed. This is a way to keep rounds from getting too long since the map is fairly large.
