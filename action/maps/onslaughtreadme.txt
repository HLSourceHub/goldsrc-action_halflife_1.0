Storyline               : 

	Fort Blivens, a military warehouse near Disney World.  Fargo McGronsky looked up from his watch. "Hmm, already 22:00," he mumbled to himself.  It had been a quiet night as usual.  Suddenly he heard a rapping at the front gate.
"Who's there?" he asked as he unholstered his Desert Eagle.
"It's Goofy and Mickey and pals!" came a cheerful voice from the other side of the link fence.
"Awesome!" Fargo giggled with delight.  He loved Goofy!  And he'd always had sexual fantasies about Minnie and Daisy.
Fargo unchained the fence and swung it open.  Instead of Goofy and Daisy and Minnie he saw his arch nemesis, Williger Hotchkiss standing there with an SG 552 aimed squarely at his chest.
"You!" Fargo yelled as he dove for cover.
"Yes, it's me, the mighty Williger Hotchkiss!" Williger cried gleefully as he pulled the trigger and let loose a torrent of bullets.
Fargo dove through the window of the nearby warehouse, whipped out his Desert Eagle and blew away the first 2 men following him.  A third man tried to dive at him, but Fargo whipped out his knife, ducked and slit the attacker's butt cheeks horizontally.
"AIEEE!" The man wallowed in a pool of his own blood and feces as his now useless sphincter muscle loosened and spewed out the rectum's contents all over the floor.  Fargo put a quick end to the man's pain with a quick bullet to the eye.
"Let Fargo be!" Williger screamed at his motley crew of terrorists.  "Get the scientists!  I want the scientists!"
"Oh no!" Fargo said to himself.  Those scientists were working on a top secret weapon.  It was so top secret and so hush-hush, that all Fargo knew about it from his eavesdropping was that it had something to do with a toilet and a roll of toilet paper.  He'd seen several scientists messing with a toilet in the building.  At first he'd thought it was just the horrible food served at this compound, but then after overhearing some conversations, he realized that the toilet was something special.
Fargo knew what he had to do.  Bipperup and Clicker BC, the top two scientists had to be rescued.  There were 5 scientists in all in the compound.
Fargo looked on the cameras in the warehouse to get a good idea of where the scientists were being held.
2 of them were locked in a closet...the door would have to be broken down because the vents in the building were too small to crawl through--but they could be used to see if someone was waiting on the other side.
The bathroom where the top secret toilet was had a bad wall that could be broken through since going through the door would be too risky.
The sewer would come in handy for sneaking in the back way.
Fargo looked at the huge green tank sitting in the warehouse.  It hadn't been run in years, and the shells were extremely old.  It might still fire though.  If he blew down a wall in the warehouse that would provide 2 exits.
Fargo got on the radio and called in the Seals.  They came in through the large warehouse door in the back--all ready to go kick some Terrorist butt.
Fargo slammed a clip into his pistol.
"Let's go team!"
