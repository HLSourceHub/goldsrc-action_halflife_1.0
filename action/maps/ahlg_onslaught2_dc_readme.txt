Premise:  Those dastardly Militia men have taken over a federal
           building!  There are hostages inside, and the SWAT team
          needs to defuse the bomb to keep everyone inside from 
          getting blown all over the place!

Militia:  This team starts out in the office building and must
          guard the bomb in the toilet area until it detonates.
          Doing so is worth 5 points.

SWAT:     The swat team must infiltrate the building and defuse
          the bomb.  This takes 5 seconds.  The reward is 5 points.
          Hostages can be rescued for 2 points each.

OTHER:    Each team gets 1 point per kill.

Good Luck!
