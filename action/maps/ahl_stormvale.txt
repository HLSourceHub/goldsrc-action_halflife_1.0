------About This Map-------------------------------------------------

First of all, this readme is being written by Jinx. This map is a conversion of Manah's open-sourced "kismet" map, originally started for the cancelled Stargate SG1 mod. The map was a pretty solid base, and I thought it would play well in AHL, so I talked to Manah and got his blessing to convert it. It has been renamed for release because it changed so much the original name didn't really fit it anymore.

Most of the map was already there when I got it; all the architecture and a lot of the texturing etc. My job was basically to fix missing textures, add spawns, add more ambience and connectivity, etc. So if you love the architectural style and texturing, thank manah... if you love the ambience, sounds, etc, thank me! And if you love both... clearly you have good taste :)

Manah also wanted me to remind mappers that the kismet open-source stuff is available on his site, http://www.planethalf-life.com/manah/. In addition to kismet there are a lot of other neat map starts in the pack that may be useful, and he has some great texture wads available as well. Just be sure to let manah know what you are doing with his stuff, and to credit him properly! He's been very generous and it's the least you can do.
