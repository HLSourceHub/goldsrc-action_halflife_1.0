banana's wad

textures beginning with mlo are texture based or containing stuff from clamtex.
the texture beginning with bx is based on a texture by bunnyx.
the rest is mine.

you can use the textures from this wad as long as you obey following rules:
1.USE THIS WAD FOR AHL MAPS ONLY!
2.DO NOT MANIPULATE OR EXTRACT DATA FROM THIS WAD, THIS MEANS ALSO INCLUDING TEXTURES INTO BSPS.



of course you can ask me (banana@gamigo.de) if you want to violate these rules, i may give my permission.
