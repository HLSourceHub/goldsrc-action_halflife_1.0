// INFO ON CUSTOM MUZZLE FLASHES ->

// Dont go overboard with the sprite scale. Big anti-aliased sprites = slow-down.
// Sprite name lets you create a custom muzzle flash for your weapon if you wish.  Make sure that the sprite is placed into the sprites/p2fx directory with exactly the same name you specify here.  If you fail to do this, AHL will crash when you or someone else shoots.

// Removing or renaming this .txt file will make AHL crash, or the muzzle be screwed up..
// The position data in this file will only affect the player view.  The sprite will be replaced for both the player and the opponents.
// If you need more help, ask on the HOF forums.

// REAL DATA FOLLOWS -> 

sprite_name=muzzle_beretta.spr
// multiply sprite size by... (use 0.33 to divide by 3, etc)
scale=4
